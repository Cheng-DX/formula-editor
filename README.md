</p>

<br>

## Features

- IMPORT üçû Auto import data and formulas from JSON file.
- EXPORT ü•ê Export and share your data and formulas.
- EDIT ü•® Transform real time.
- [COMPOSABLE](#composable) ü•Ø Use data code in formula moreover use formulas' code in another formula.
- CUSTOMIZE ü•ñ You can customize the formula editor's style.
- BRACKET ü´ì Use brackets freely, `{}` `[]` `<>` `()` are supported.
- [SUGER](#suger) üç¨ `^2` and `^0.5` is avialable to make the formula more clear.

## Usage

### composable

There are some tips:

- Use brackets to surround data, formulas will be enclosed in the brackets automatically.
- Depth of formula nesting should less then `10`.
- Any formulas' or data's `codes` should not compeletely contain the `code` of other data or formula. This might cause unexpected results.

  _I know this limitation can be solved but I don't have a good idea right now.`PR welcome`_

### suger

- `^2` means square.`(someCode)^2` will be parsed as `square(someCode)`. This is my Aviator's custom function, you can change this by replaceing the template string of function _`square`_ in the file _[transformFn.ts](./src/core/transformFn.ts)_.
- `^0.5` means square root.`(someCode)^0.5` will be parsed as `math.sqrt(someCode)`. This is the same with Aviator preset function.
- Make your own `Suger` by add new transform function. Well,`PR welcome` too.
